# pkbs - Personal Kubernetes Batch System

## About

This software harnesses Kubernetes to run batch jobs.

## Design

![k8s design](./doc/design.svg)

Storage service and centralized logging resides in the `pkbs-system`
namespace. The reference implementation uses NextCloud with persistent
storage, but external service can also be utilized.  The logical
'queue' is implemented in the `pkebs` namespace with NATS messaging
system, `dispatcher` pod, and `worker-dep` deployment.  The horizontal
autoscaler `worker-hpa` dynamically adjusts the worker replicas based
on processing workload.

![job flowchart](./doc/flow.svg)

Right: schematics of the job processing flow.  The `qsub` invoked
by the user (1) submits the job to the `dispatcher` pod, which then publishes
it (2) to the NATS JetStream and creates the job's bookkeeping data
(3) in the key-value store.  The workers get their input (4) from the
JetStream and update the job state data (5) in the key-value
store. Worker instances have no persistent storage, therefore they
upload (6) their results to a storage service.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* GNU/Linux workstation or server, virtual machine (VM) works fine
* [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
* [kustomize](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/installation/kustomize/)
* Kubernetes cluster
* Optional: an external WebDAV service

### Installation

### Submitting batch jobs

Commands can be read from standard input.
```
echo "sleep 1" | qsub -N sleep
```
The `qsub` can be invoked with an executable file as an argument.
```
qsub -N calc examples/calculation/calc.sh
```
The `qsub` can be invoked with a directory name as an argument. In this case, the directory must include a file named `run.sh` at the top level. The contents of the directory is then zipped up and submitted for scheduling. There zip file can be at most 1 MB.
```
qsub -N hello-world examples/hello-world
```
In all cases the payload can be up to 1 MB.
